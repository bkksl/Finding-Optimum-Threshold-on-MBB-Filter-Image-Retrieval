# Finding-Optimum-Threshold-on-MBB-Filter-Image-Retrieval
Exploratory study for MBB (Murat Büşra Burcu) edge detection filter. Uses deep learning-based Image Retrieval (pretrained VGG16, BIPED dataset) to automatically find the optimum threshold by comparing filter outputs against ground truth for enhanced edge detection accuracy.
